## üîÑ Sorting Persistence

Your inventory sorting preferences are now automatically saved and restored!

### How It Works
1. Sort your inventory by any column (name, color, quantity, etc.)
2. Your preference is automatically saved in your browser
3. When you return to the inventory page, your sort is restored
4. Works across page refreshes and browser sessions

### Features
- **Automatic**: No configuration needed - just sort normally
- **Per-Browser**: Each browser remembers its own preference
- **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't interfere with search or manual sorting
- **Persistent**: Survives page refreshes and browser restarts

### Technical Details
- Uses browser localStorage API
- Stores: `{"sort": "name", "dir": "asc"}`
- Gracefully degrades if localStorage unavailable
- Does not sync across devices (browser-specific)

**No Setup Required** - Just sort your inventory and it's automatically remembered!

## Migration Required

To use these features, run:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This creates the `inventory_backup` table for storing backup metadata.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Migration**: `python manage.py migrate`
2. **Test Manual Backup**: Settings ‚Üí Backups ‚Üí "Create Backup Now"
3. **Schedule Backups** (optional): See `QUICK_START_BACKUPS.md`
4. **Try Sorting**: Sort your inventory and refresh the page - your sort persists!

---

## Backward Compatibility

These features are **fully backward compatible**:
- No existing functionality is changed
- Migration is required but safe
- Sorting persistence is optional (doesn't affect users without localStorage)
- Backup system is opt-in (no automatic backups without setup)
